# Security Code of Conductüîí

## Introduction üëã

The security of our project and its users is of utmost importance. This Security Code of Conduct outlines the expectations and responsibilities of contributors and users to ensure the safety and integrity of the project.

## Reporting Security Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us privately. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed. You can report security issues by emailing us at [luisrosarioalers@gmail.com](luisrosarioalers@gmail.com).

## Responsible Disclosureüìù

We ask that you:

- **Act in good faith** to avoid privacy violations.
- **Provide us with a reasonable amount of time** to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a third party.
- **Avoid exploiting the vulnerability** for any reason, including demonstrating additional risk.

## Security Best Practicesüôé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To ensure the security of our project, we expect contributors to adhere to the following best practices:

- **Use Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts related to the project.
- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions.
- **Validate Input**: Always validate and sanitize input to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and other possible exploits.
- **Use Secure Communication**: Use secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) for all interactions with the project.
- **Review Code Changes**: Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and address potential security issues.

## Enforcement‚úã

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [luisrosarioalers@gmail.com](luisrosarioalers@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Consequences of Violations‚ùó

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Security Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
