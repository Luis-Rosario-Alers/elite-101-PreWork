                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users’ freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the software, if they
receive widespread use, become available for incorporation in the
free version. Many developers of free software are encouraged to
release their changes as free software. You are encouraged to do so.

These explanations are intended to make the GNU Affero General Public
License more understandable to non-lawyers, but it does not change
the meaning of any of the terms of this License.

                             TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-----------------------------

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

"Author" means any contributor to the Program.

"You" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this License.

"Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work, in which a human
can make modifications. "Object Code" means any non-source form of a work.

"Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined
by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular
programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

"System Libraries" of a work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that is
included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
Major Component, and which (a) is an integral part of the Major Component, or (b) is designed
to interface with the Major Component at arm’s length, or (c) can be used interchangeably with
the Major Component in all respects.

A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system,
etc.) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler
used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed
to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work,
including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries,
or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
those activities but are not part of the work.

The "Installation Information" for a User Product is any methods, procedures, authorization keys,
or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a work in that User Product
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the
continued functioning of the modified object code is identical to that of the original object code.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
"Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program,
and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your
unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is
covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This
License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable
law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on 20 December
1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact
all notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may not offer warranty on the Program, or any work that you convey, in a way that limits or
restricts the recipients' rights in the work.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program,
in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any
    conditions added under section 7.

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into
    possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable sections of the GNU
    General Public License, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices;
    however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display any output, this requirement may not apply.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also
convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of the following ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium),
together with the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium),
together with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give you a copy of the Corresponding Source to
anyone who comes into possession of the object code. This written offer must be valid for at least three years
and must state that the Corresponding Source will be provided if you request it.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.
    This alternative is allowed only occasionally and non-commercially, and only if you received the object code with
    such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent
    access to the Corresponding Source at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding
    Source along with the object code.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and
    Corresponding Source of the work are being made available.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,
need not be covered by this License.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included
in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any
licenses granted by the work's authors under this License).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your licenses shall automatically be reinstated to the extent
that such cessation is reasonably foreseeable. Provisions that cannot be reasonably enforced under applicable law may be
given effect to the maximum extent possible.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a
covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy constitutes
acceptance of the License for that copy.

10. Automatic Licensing of Contributions.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run,
modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" means any transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets,
or the business of a contributing entity.

If a covered work is transferred as an "entity transaction," all recipients of the work, including all subsequent recipients,
shall have licenses for the entire work and accept this License; however, independent secondary licensors, including
those making modifications to the work or receiving copies, need not hold warranties of any kind in relation to the work.

11. Patents.

A contributor hereby grants you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
run, modify, and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is included in a contributor’s license to the extent necessary
to grant you:

   (a) the right to make, use, sell, and import the contributed code;

   (b) the right to make, use, sell, and import modifications of the code, which are based on the original work; and

   (c) the right to combine the original work with other code to produce a larger work.

No license is granted to a contributor’s patent claims that would be infringed by independently developing or
using a work that does not contain the contributor’s code.

If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any entity alleging that the
Program or a component thereof constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to you under this License for that Program shall terminate as of the date litigation is filed.

12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For
example, if you have a warranty obligation under a separate agreement, it does not excuse you from the conditions
of this License.

13. Use with the GNU General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a
work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the
resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work
with which it is combined may be governed by different terms.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from
time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the version you have adopted, but may differ in detail
to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the
GNU Affero General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR CONVEY THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according
to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that is consistent with the intent expressed here, or as close to
the intent as possible.

                            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
