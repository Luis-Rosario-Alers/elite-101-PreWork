# Gitflow Workflow

Gitflow is a robust branching model designed to help manage feature development, releases, and hotfixes in a consistent and organized way.

## Overview

The Gitflow workflow uses several types of branches:

- **Master**: Contains production-ready code.
- **Develop**: Serves as an integration branch for features and prepares the next release.
- **Feature branches**: Branch off from `develop` for developing new features. Use the naming format `feature/your-feature-name`.
- **Release branches**: Branch off from `develop` when preparing a new release. These branches allow for final bug fixes and testing before merging into `master` and `develop`.
- **Hotfix branches**: Branch off from `master` to quickly address critical issues in production. After fixes, merge these back into both `master` and `develop`.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Creating a Feature Branch**
   - Branch from `develop` using the naming convention: `feature/description`.
   - Develop your feature with regular commits.

2. **Merging a Feature Branch**
   - Once the feature is complete and tested, merge it back into `develop`.

3. **Creating a Release Branch**
   - Branch from `develop` when preparing for a release using the naming format: `release/x.y.z`.
   - Stabilize the release, apply any necessary fixes, and prepare for deployment.

4. **Merging a Release Branch**
   - After final testing, merge the release branch into `master` (to deploy) and back into `develop` (to update the development branch).

5. **Hotfixes**
   - If an urgent bug arises in production, branch from `master` using the format: `hotfix/description`.
   - After fixing the issue, merge the hotfix branch back into both `master` and `develop`.

## Best Practices

- Always ensure your branch names are clear and descriptive.
- Regularly synchronize your branches with `develop` or `master` as applicable to minimize merge conflicts.
- Test all changes thoroughly before merging into critical branches.
